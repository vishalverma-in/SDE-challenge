/*Approach:
1. Maintain a min variable which will hold the value of minimum element in the vector.
2. Initialize a variable profit to 0 to hold the profit earned.
3. Iterate through the whole vector once.
4. Start from index 0 and update min whenever the minimum element than the previous is encounterd.
5. Update profit by computing prices[i]-min if it is greater that the previous profit otherwise 0 will be returned.*/
